## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)

fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp + Solar.R, data = airquality)

plot(fit)
```

Here is a table of regression coefficients.


```{r warning=FALSE, results="asis"}

library(xtable)
xt <- xtable(summary(fit))
print(xt, type = "html")

```
