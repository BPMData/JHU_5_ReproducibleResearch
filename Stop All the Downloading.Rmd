```{r setup, include=FALSE}

      Stop all the downloading.
      

Here's the code to download the dataset - I'm taking it out of my RMD until I'm ready to publish because the cache isn't working and it keeps downloading over and over. 

```
#Here we download our dataset, if it's not already downloaded, and read it as a tibble into RStudio.

fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2" # Set the DL link url.

if(!file.exists("./Proj2data/Stormdata.csv.bs2")) {download.file(fileUrl,destfile="./Proj2data/StormData.csv.bz2",method="curl")} # Actually download the file.

gunzip(filename = "./Proj2data/StormData.csv.bz2", destname = "./Proj2data/StormData.csv",
       skip = TRUE, ext = "bz2")

```

Okay.
