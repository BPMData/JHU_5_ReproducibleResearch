## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Google Activity
[This is what I'm following](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-r/quiz/ktFaF/hands-on-activity-your-r-markdown-notebook/attempt)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# We added warning = FALSE because IDC that you removed two outlier rows and neither would the person reading this

ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)) +
      geom_point(aes(color = species)) +
      scale_color_manual(values = c("plum", "salmon", "navajowhite2")) +
      facet_wrap(~species)
```

<h1 align="center">This is my prettiest graph</h1>

*** 

```
This does not work even though it should

#This is my prettiest graph

This does work, as you'll see below:

<h1 align="center">This is my prettiest graph</h1>

```
***
<h1 align="center">**This** is *my* prettiest ***graph***</h1>
*** 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) + 
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = market_segment, fill = customer_type)) + 
      facet_wrap(~hotel) +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size = 6, margin = margin(10))) + 
      scale_fill_manual(name = "Customer Type", values = wes_palette(4, name = "Zissou1", type = "continuous")) +
      labs(title = "Customer Bookings by\n Hotel Type and Customer Type 2",
           x = "Market Segment", 
           y = "Total Customer Bookings",
           caption = paste0("Data from 2015 to 2017 / Legend Title Size 8, Text 6")) + # Let's center our title
      theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

```{r}

with(diamonds, table(cut,clarity))
```

From here on out, I'm following [this link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-r/lecture/ix21Z/structure-of-markdown-documents)

Okay:

In RMarkdown, you can create the following types of files 

* HTML
     + They're cool
* PDF
  + Please don't make me have to edit these
* .Docx files
  + Proprietary but I like it TBH
    + Does this work too?
      + Every two spaces is a new indentation

1. HTML
  + Please don't make me have to 
    + Edit these

[Now I'm here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-r/quiz/5N6hc/hands-on-activity-adding-code-chunks-to-r-markdown-notebooks/attempt)

```{r ggplot for penguin data}

data(penguins)

View(penguins)

```

```{r ggplot for penguin data visualization, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = penguins) +

[Output Formats Available in RMarkdown](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-r/supplement/BS3Mb/output-formats-in-r-markdown)

* pdf_document – This creates a PDF file with LaTeX (an open source document layout system). If you don’t already have LaTeX, RStudio will automatically prompt you to install it.

* word_document – This creates a Microsoft Word document (.docx).

* odt_document – This creates an OpenDocument Text document (.odt).

* rtf_document – This creates a Rich Text Format document (.rtf).  

* md_document – This creates a Markdown document (which strictly conforms to the original Markdown specification)

* github_document – This creates a GitHub document which is a customized version of a Markdown document designed for sharing on GitHub.


      Saving your report as a html_notebook by changing the parameters in the heading creates a nb.html file that can be opened in a browser as a regular html file OR in RStudio to see the embedded source code as if it was an .rmd file.

~~Hunt's Tomato Ketchup is the best~~

Everyone knows Heinz^2^ tomato ketchup is the best

Everyone knows curry~2~ ketchup is the best

Do I need to actually type superscript^2^ to make it work?

Or type out subscript~2~ to make it work?

Actually it's putting ^your^ ^text^ ^between^ ^carrots^ such as ^ that makes it superscript  

Putting it between ~tildes~ ~like~ ~this~ makes it subscript  

You have to put the ^ or ~ around every single word


# One hashtag
## Two hashtags
### Three hashtags
**** 
#### Four hashtags after a line break
##### Five hashtags
###### Six hashtags
####### Seven hashtags is too many it looks like
######## And so is 8 hashtags

*One asterisk is italics.*

**Two is bold.**

      If you start typing when indented you get a 
      Block like 
      this
      
```
If you start typing in a code block without {r}, you can basically make comments.

```

I'm not sure if 

> this block quote looks different than  
> what you get if you type after an   indent  
>> Not sure if two arrows does anything either

Here's some latex: $A^2 + B^2 = C^2$

Inline code is like `Hello world` or `r nrow(cars)` cars studied
