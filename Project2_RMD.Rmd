```{r}

```


```{r setup, include=TRUE}
# This is our initial setup block, named setup, with include = TRUE so it will show up.  

# First we'll set any global variables we care about...
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(scipen=999) # This stops knitr from displaying 5 digit numbers as Scientific Notation.

# And then load our data. 

actdata <- read.csv("repdata_data_activity/activity.csv")

# And the only library call we'll need:

library(tidyverse)
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
